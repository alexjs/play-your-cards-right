# Play Your Cards Right

One of the suggestions at #NHTG12 was to make the [rather fun app](http://hacks.rewiredstate.org/events/nhtg12/play-your-cards-right) by [Jordan](http://jordanh.net/) also support civil servant salaries.

This is a dirty hack, based on data released [June 2010](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Nl1/Newsroom/DG_188114) to do just that. It includes the top 147 paid civil servants across some governmental organisations.
